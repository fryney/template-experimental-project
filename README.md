# Template for structuring an experimental project

This repository serves as a template for structuring the different types of files and information needed for an experimental project, e.g., code for your experiment, analysis, and final writing.

It contains five subfolders:
* **analyses**: should contain scripts to process, visualize and analyze the data
* **data**: should contain the raw and preprocessed data from all experiments (pilot and main)
* **experiment**: should contain everything relevant to understanding and reproducing the experiment
* **notes**: can serve for internal bookkeeping, share notes from meetings, thoughts, etc.
* **writing**: storage for all written reports of the project: final write-up, term paper, report, publication, etc.
